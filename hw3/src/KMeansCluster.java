        • Output-> set of k clusters
        • Method
        (1) arbitrarily select k objects from D as the initial
        cluster mean (centroids)
        (2) reassign each object to the cluster to which it is most
        similar, based upon the distance between the object
        and the cluster centroid
        (3) update cluster centroid using objects in each cluster
        (4) Repeat (2) and (3) until the criterion function
        converges (no redistribution of objects in any cluster)*/
